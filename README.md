#a number-guessing game that generates a number between the range of 1 and 2. The game would prompt users for their usernames.
and it also set range as a function parameter and prompts the player to predict the generated number between the given range. At a correct guess, the game would award the player a point and move them to stage 2 by increasing the range limit value by 1, e.g. range is from 1 and 3 for stage 2 and so on.
